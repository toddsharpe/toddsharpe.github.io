Decided to finally bite the bullet and set up Github Pages. Found these pages helpful:
* <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll>
* <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/>

I had to add webrick to the bundle manually as that page says.
```
bundle add webrick
```

Serving this page from ruby command prompt:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

WIll just be a collection of notes I take while working on projects. Not quite as polished as <https://fabiensanglard.net/> but something along the lines looks wise.
